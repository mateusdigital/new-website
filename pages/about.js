                I was born in France and raised in Romans-Sur-Isere where I spent most of my time playing soccer but somehow
                managed to graduate with a Master of Science in Computer Science from Grenoble University (French Alps).

            <p>
                In 2003, two days after graduating I started to work in Paris as a Software Engineer. I spent one year there
                coding by day and rollerblading by night.<br/><br/>

            <p>
                In 2004 I left to Toronto, Canada with a Work Holiday Visa in order to "Explore, Dream and Discover" the world
                but mostly in order to improve my English. I was planning on staying five months but I ended up living there for
                nine years.<br/>
                <br/> My first job was busboy at the N'awlins on King Street!
                I quickly went back to programming and worked in various cool places, such as Rogers and QuickPlay as a Software
                Engineer.
                Eventually I created my own company: Memset Software.<br/><br/>

            <p>
                Hi! I'm Sarah Fossheim (pronouns: they/them), and I work as a front-end developer and inclusive designer. I'm
                passionate about accessibility, dataviz, and building ethical technology.

                I enjoy making drawings with CSS, I write about tech and collect ethical design resources. You can check ou/t
                what I'm currently working on through inprogress.fossheim.io.
                I'm located in Oslo, Norway, and working independently. You can hire me on a freelance basis for accessibility
                projects, creative coding and front-end consulting. I'm also open to do talks, workshops and training sessions.
                I'm taking on new clients from Febr/uary 2023 onwards.
                My favorite work projects are those where I get to work at the intersection of different disciplines, and
                combine my engineering and user experience design background to solve complex problems - all while keeping a
                focus on accessibility, ethics and user experience.
                I have worked in-house in the edtech and biotech sector, where I focused on building intuitive front-ends for
                data-heavy products. I have also worked as a consultant with both startups, the public sector and large
                corporations.
                Since starting my own business mid 2021, I mainly focus on accessibility and inclusive design.
                Depending on the project, this can mean a variety of things: performing (dataviz) accessibility reviews, having
                training sessions, writing documentation, implementing accessibility improvements and bugfixes, or developing
                new features with accessibility and WCAG compliance in mind from the start.
                I also build user friendly and accessible websites, prototypes and web apps.
